# Hobby List
##### Lab 03: SystemIO and local file persistence  
#### collaborators: Harry Cogswell, Brandon Johnson, Rosalyn Johnson, Brody Rebne

## Summary
This is a C# Console Application that lets a user create a list of hobbies, add hobbies to that list, remove them from the list, and delete the list as they see fit. A user should find the same list of hobbies every time they open the app, until they modify or delete it!

## Directions
- In order to install this app and try it for yourself, clone this repo using
git clone https://github.com/HCoggers/Lab03-SystemIO.git

- Then open ./Lab03-SystemIO/Lab03-SystemIO.sln within Visual Studio

- Run the solution from Visual Studio.

## Furthermore
Keep in mind, you can only have one list at a time. To create a brand new one, you must first delete the old list.  
In the future, we would like to give the user the ability to name their lists, so they can save and load multiple lists!
