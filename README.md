# Hobby List
##### Lab 03: SystemIO and local file persistence  
#### collaborators: Harry Cogswell, Brandon Johnson, Rosalyn Johnson, Brody Rebne

## Summary
This is a C# Console Application that lets a user create a list of hobbies, add hobbies to that list, remove them from the list, and delete the list as they see fit. A user should find the same list of hobbies every time they open the app, until they modify or delete it!

## Directions
- In order to install this app and try it for yourself, clone this repo using
git clone https://github.com/HCoggers/Lab03-SystemIO.git

- Then open ./Lab03-SystemIO/Lab03-SystemIO.sln within Visual Studio

- Run the solution from Visual Studio.

-Now there should be a prompt on your screen asking you to make a selection

-Choose from that list: add, view, delete hobbies or delete the entire list. At this point you can also exit the program.

-Have fun! Play around with the list you create. But know that if you try to make the same item more than once; their is code to stop duplicates.

-When you are done exit the program until you want to change the list again. Your list will be waiting for you!

## Furthermore
Keep in mind, you can only have one list at a time. To create a brand new one, you must first delete the old list.  
In the future, we would like to give the user the ability to name their lists, so they can save and load multiple lists! Your list will not except duplicates. Unless you choose to delete the list then it will remain even if you close the program.
